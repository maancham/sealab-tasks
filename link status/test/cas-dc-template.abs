Most modern information technology devices use
the Internet for creating, reading, updating, and deleting
shared data through remote inter-process communication ({\sc ipc}).
To evaluate the energy consumption of {\sc ipc} technologies
and the corresponding run-time performance implications,
we performed an empirical study on popular {\sc ipc} systems
implemented in Go, Java, JavaScript, Python, {\sc php}, Ruby,
and C\#.
We performed our experiments on computer platforms equipped with
Intel and {\sc arm} processors.
We observed that JavaScript and Go implementations of g{\sc rpc}
offer the lowest energy consumption and execution time.
Furthermore, by analysing their system call traces,
we found that inefficient use of system calls
can contribute to increased energy consumption
and poor execution time.
