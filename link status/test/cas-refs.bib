However, there is limited number of research works regarding the energy consumption of relatively small programming tasks. This knowledge is critical to be known especially in cases where millions of small tasks are running in parallel on multiple devices all around the globe. Goal: In this preliminary study, we aim to identify energy implications of small, independent tasks developed in different programming languages; compiled, semi-compiled, and interpreted ones. Method: To achieve our purpose, we collected, refined, compared, and analyzed a number of implemented tasks from Rosetta Code, that is a publicly available Repository for programming chrestomathy. Results: Our analysis shows that among compiled programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Go offer the highest energy efficiency for all of our tested tasks compared to C\#, VB.Net, and Rust. Regarding interpreted programming languages PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript exhibit the most energy savings compared to Swift, R, Perl, and Python.},

	doi = {10.7287/peerj.preprints.1219v2},
	abstract = {Energy consumption is a major concern when devel- oping and evolving mobile applications. The user wishes to access fast and powerful mobile applications, which is usually in contrast to optimized battery life and heat generation. The software engineering community have acknowledged the relevance of the problem and researchers are investigating ways to reduce energy consumption, for example by examining which library, device configuration, and applications parameters should be used to promote long battery life. We conjecture that these studies are at the border between hardware and software and we must be careful on how the energy consumption is measured and how the energy consumption is attributed to methods and libraries. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work investigates how much energy and power consumption is due to high frequency events missed when sampling at low frequencies such as 10 kHz and verified the error at the precision of method level. Low frequency sampling is a rough approximation that hinders the understanding of fine grain details: the real picture of energy consumption as well as the root causes are missed. This has profound implications on the choice of methods to evolve or components to replace. In this paper, we propose an approach for accurate measurements of the energy consumption of mobile applications. We apply the proposed approach to assess the energy consumption of 21 mobile, closed source, applications and four open source Android applications. We show that by sampling at 10 kHz one may expect a median error of 8\%, however, such error may be as high as 50\% for short fast executing methods. Finally, we revisit a previous approach that estimates the energy consumption of methods based on execution time and found that it can miss as much as 84\% of the energy, with a median of 30\%.
